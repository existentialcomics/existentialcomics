the same name as my github so ignore this. This is just the code that runs existential comics
Python/Flask)

# About Me

I'm a Software Engineer specializing in LAMP open source software, with additional experience in DevOps and database administration. Lifelong learner who is always looking to prove how ignorant I was five years ago. I believe it was Socrates who famously said "everyone is pretty dumb when you think about it", something like that anyway.

## Projects
#### Existential Comics
The software that runs exitentialcomics.com. Python/Flask backend, basic html/css frontend.  
existentialcomics.com
#### Kung Fu Chess
A realtime chess game where all the pieces move at once and have to recharge. Backend in Perl / Mojoliscious. Frontend in bootstap,scss,vue,jquery. Custom chess AI in c++.  
kungfuchess.org
#### Captain Ascii
A realtime multiplayer space game that runs purely in the terminal. Real nerd shit. You can build your ship out of the ships you destroy, and like 30 different weapons, and 10 different ship modules (cloaking, warp, autoaim, etc). Written in perl, mutiplayer over UNIX socket, AI for enemies.
#### Foosball game
A real time foosball game in websockets/perl/javascript I wrote over the weekend when lockdown started so I could still play foosball with the guys at the office.
#### Gender Wars
A ranking API to store and rank all things accord to their gender (i.e. will ask users questions like "what is more masculine, the concept of irony or a moose?"). Python / fastAPI
#### Acscii encoder
Encode .mp4 into ascii only movies that can be played on the terminal.
